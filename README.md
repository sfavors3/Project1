Project1: {with 3 attachments: run_analysis.r, Project.txt, codebook.md} 

This repo contains run_analysis.r script which takes the training and test dataset from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone dataset and extracts the row labels, column labels, activity decriptions for the training and test datasets.  Merge is done to create one dataset in which the mean and standard deviation columns are extracted into a single dataset.  That dataset is then grouped and that final dataset is written to a text file.  The codebook describing the variables used along with the final text file is also included in this repo.
